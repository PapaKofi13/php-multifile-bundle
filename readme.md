# OVERVIEW
I've noticed uploading multiple files with php has been a hustle for most beginners, so i wrote this little class to do the work for you :)

__PHP MULTIFILE BUNDLE__ is fully customizable and provides the following services for you

- __Prettify__ the file from the standard php $_FILE superglobal array to a more readable and grouped form

- __Handles validation__ it handles all your file validations in a more recommended way that you won't have to worry about security issues, developers may also return the pretty array by calling the _pretty_ method and implement their own custom validation which suits them.

- __Zip Generater__ Developers also have an option to create a zip file for each user which contains a particular users file data
